My name is Gregory Lent, and I am a statistics, mathematics, and programming nerd. I have a B.S. in Applied Statistics from California State University, Long Beach. I currently work as a college math tutor, and am looking to break into the Data Science field! I love to find ways to apply my skills to the real world, and this blog is my way to share what I find.
